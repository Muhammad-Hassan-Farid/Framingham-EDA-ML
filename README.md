# Framingham Heart Study: Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning
This project involves an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and machine learning implementation based on the Framingham Heart Study dataset. The notebook demonstrates data preprocessing, visualization, and predictive modeling to assess cardiovascular disease risk factors.

## Project Structure
The project consists of a Jupyter Notebook:

### Framingham-EDA-ML.ipynb:
The primary notebook for conducting EDA and implementing machine learning models.
## Key Features
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Comprehensive analysis of the dataset to uncover patterns, relationships, and distributions.
Visualization of key features influencing cardiovascular disease risk.

## Data Preprocessing:
Handling missing values.
Normalization and encoding of categorical variables.
## Machine Learning Models:
Implementation of classification algorithms to predict cardiovascular disease risk.
Evaluation metrics to assess model performance.

## Insights:
Identification of major factors contributing to heart disease.
Discussion of actionable insights derived from the analysis.

## Requirements
The following Python libraries are used in this project:
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
Ensure you have these packages installed in your environment. You can install them using:

#### pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
